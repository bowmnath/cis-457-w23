## Welcome to CIS 457!

This is the main website for the course.
The slides, schedule, and links to assignments, labs, projects, and videos,
as well as the official course policies,
will be posted here.
The course also uses other websites for specific purposes.
* [Piazza](https://piazza.com/gvsu/winter2023/cis457/home) is a question-and-answer forum.
*All official announcements will be sent through Piazza*,
and you are responsible for monitoring Piazza to keep up to date with
announcements
(Piazza by default will send an email when an announcement is posted).
    * You can read the following [Piazza FAQ](misc/piazza-faq.md) if you have
      questions.
* [Prairielearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/) is where you will
submit all of your assignments, labs, and projects.
After submitting to Prairielearn, don't forget to update the
["Grade me" spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1glDciHPm0gUrf8-t37OC8wYEyW0R3FlxAw-WxERvWQY/edit?usp=sharing)
as described in the syllabus.
* [ClassTranscribe](https://classtranscribe.illinois.edu/) is where the videos
will be hosted.

That seems like a lot to monitor,
but don't worry -- you really need only actively follow Piazza.
I will release announcements there any time assignments or videos are assigned,
and I will post links to them directly on this page.

Be sure to read through the [syllabus](syllabus.md) for course policies,
contact information, and other important info.
