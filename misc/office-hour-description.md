# What are office hours?

Office hours are time available to you to meet with me outside of class.
Attendance is optional,
but the time is there for your benefit.
You do not need to make an appointment to see me if you are coming to one
of my scheduled office hours.
I specifically set office hour times aside for these meetings with students.
You are not "bothering" me if you come to office hours --
I do not plan other work to do during these times.

You might come to office hours because:
* you have questions about lecture material
* you have questions about coursework, such as homework, labs, or projects
* you have questions going beyond what is covered in class because you have
  developed an interest in the subject
* you are seeking personal advice about your major, job seeking, graduate
  school, etc.
* you have any miscellaneous difficulties related to the course
  (partner being non-communicative, feeling that you are falling behind, etc.)
* you are experiencing personal difficulties
  (mental health, lack of access to housing, food, internet, etc.).
  I am not a mental-health expert,
  but I will listen and I can help refer you to relevant GVSU resources if
  desired

The above list is meant to give you a general idea,
but not to be exhaustive.
If you don't exactly see your concern on the list above,
it's fine --
you are still encouraged to come to office hours.

If you plan to ask me for a letter of recommendation in the future,
in addition to doing well in the course,
it can be helpful to come to office hours occasionally so that I get to know
you and your interests better.

## Coming prepared for office hours

Students can save *a lot* of time by coming to office hours with questions
about course material or assignments,
especially if
(1) they come shortly after the material is covered or assignment is posted,
and (2) they come prepared.

### Preparing for questions about course material

When coming with questions about the lecture videos or activities,
coming prepared means
* having watched the lecture video on the topic in question
* having made a good-faith effort to complete the activity,
  even if you were not able to make much progress
* trying to be as specific as possible about what is confusing you.
  For example, instead of "I do not understand the lecture on recursion,"
  a better question would be
  "I thought the example on slide five of the recursion lecture should print
  12, but it prints 24, and I'm not sure why."
  It is okay if you cannot be as specific as that example,
  but the more specific you are the more helpful my answers will likely be
  for you.

### Preparing for questions about assignments

Asking for help with an assignment is a great use of office hours,
but when requesting help with an assignment,
do not simply expect me to complete it for you.
Coming prepared with questions about coursework means,
at a minimum,
you have read the entire description of the problem, project, etc. in
question.
If you have a general question about how to approach a problem,
such as "I don't get how to do number four,"
I may clarify the wording for you or point you to relevant information from
the videos.
If you can be more specific,
such as "my solution for number four is off by factor of two from what I would
expect,"
I can give more specific advice on how to approach your issue.

### Preparing for help with debugging

I will also help you debug your code for assignments in this course if you come
to office hours,
as long as you have come prepared.
Coming prepared for help with debugging means
* you have made a good-faith effort to debug on your own
* you have attempted to identify as specifically as possible inputs or
  situations that cause your program to fail
* you have narrowed down the issue to the smallest section of code that you are
  able to

Just as with other questions,
almost anything is welcome,
but more specific is better.
A general debugging question such as "Why is my program not working?" will
likely lead to general advice such as adding print statements in the relevant
functions or using a debugger.
On the other hand,
a specific problem such as
"Line eight seems to overwrite my array with zeros,
but I don't understand why"
will lead to a much more direct answer from me and a faster resolution for you.
